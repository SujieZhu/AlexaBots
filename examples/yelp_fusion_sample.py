"""
Yelp Fusion API code sample.
Currently only takes:
Location
Query Terms

and prints info for the top result business (no sorting order) and also reviews.

This program demonstrates the capability of the Yelp Fusion API
by using the Search API to query for businesses by a search term and location,
and the Business API to query additional information about the top result
from the search query.
Please refer to http://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/documentation for the API
documentation.
Sample usage of the program:
`python sample.py --term="bars" --location="San Francisco, CA"`
